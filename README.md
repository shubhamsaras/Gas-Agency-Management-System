# Gas-Agency-Management-System
The study was driven by recognition that the GAS AGENCY sector had recently  experienced fundamental changes and that an approach to comprehensive project  benchmarking had not been widely adopted to date.  Our project related to this background includes all the basic details about the currently  present Administrator, Customer, Distributor, etc. We are implementing insert, update and  delete operation in this database.  All the actions performed at the front end will be reflected at the back end. This can be used  for both small scale as well as large scale data management in GAS agency companies.
